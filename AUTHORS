The programm KDVI is based on the dvi-previewer xdvik, See below. KDVI
was written by Markku Hihnala with the help of many
collaborators. Later KDVI became a plug-in to KViewShell and Stefan
Kebekus re-implemented parts of the program. The current version of
KDVI shares a substantial amount of code with xdvi, not not very much
with the first versions of KDVI.
