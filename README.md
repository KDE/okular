## Contributing

Okular uses the merge request workflow.
Merge requests are required to run pre-commit CI jobs; please don’t push to the master branch directly.
See https://community.kde.org/Infrastructure/GitLab for an introduction.

### Build instructions

Okular can be built like many other applications developed by KDE.
See https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved/development for an introduction.

If your build environment is set up correctly, you can also build Okular using CMake:

```bash
git clone https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular.git
cd okular
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/install/dir ..
make
make install
```

If you install Okular in a different path than your system install directory it is possible that you need to run

```bash
source build/prefix.sh; okular
```

so that the correct Okular instance and libraries are picked up.

As stated above, Okular has various build targets.
Two of them are executables.
You can choose which executable to build by passing a flag to CMake:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/install/dir -DOKULAR_UI=desktop ..
```
Available options are `desktop`, `mobile`, and `both`.

### clang-format

The Okular project uses clang-format to enforce source code formatting.
See [README.clang_format](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/blob/master/README.clang-format) for more information.
