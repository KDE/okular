ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT

o implement SaveAs

o feedback when running kpsewhich or ghostview

o "Helper-Application" setup


HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Speedup, in particular for ghostscript and kpsewhich.

o Support for colored font specials

o Support for click-on-dvi => editor (klyx!) jumps to proper position. This is
  included in the windows distribution of TeX. We should really catch up!

o Support papersize information given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.

o Extra enlargement of characters for improved readability should be switchable.

o Rotated Postscript should be supported.


NOT SO URGENT

o Document info dialog
o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Redirect error messages to a window
o More background processing to keep the UI responsive
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o Popup-Window to inform the user when Fonts are generated
o Search option
o dynamical storage allocation for hyperlinks (see dviwin.h)
o more robust Error handling with throw/catch; no need to abort just because a PK-file is bad.
